This programming assignment contains two simple client server programs.
The first one simply has the client send a string to the server, and the server sends a message
back acknowledging that it recieved the message.

 The second program extends the first so that the client can send a request of how many messages to send.
The server can then parse the request and subsequent messages. Error checking is included to make sure no faulty messages are sent.
For more information I have included the orginal assigment pdf given out labeled PA1
