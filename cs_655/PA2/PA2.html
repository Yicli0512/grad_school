<P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P><a href="PA2-cs455-GradingCriteria.txt">PA2 Grading Criteria</a><P>In this second programming assignment, you will be writing the sending 
and receiving transport-level code for implementing the&nbsp;Go-Back-N reliable data 
transfer protocol. This  should be <B>fun</B> since your implementation will differ very little from what 
would be required in a real-world situation. 
<P><strong>CS 655 students should also complete an extension to this assignment -- <a href="#cs655ext">see below</a>.</strong>
<P>Since we do not have standalone machines (with an OS that you can modify), 
your code will have to execute in a simulated hardware/software environment. 
However, the programming interface provided to your routines (i.e., 
the code that would call your entities from above (i.e., from layer 5, denoting 
the application layer) and from below 
(i.e., from layer 3, denoting the network layer) is very close to what is done in an actual UNIX 
environment. (Indeed, the software interfaces described in this programming 
assignment are much more realistic that the infinite loop senders and receivers 
that the textbook describes). Stopping/starting 
of timers are also simulated, and timer interrupts will cause your timer 
handling routine to be activated. 
<P><font color="#ff0000">The description of the routines below is given in C.&nbsp; 
See text at end regarding the C++ and Java versions of this assignment. Note 
that you do not need a network connection to run this assignment, so you can do 
it pretty much on any machine you would like. </font>
<font color="#ff0000" face="arial,arial,helvetica">Recall however, that you need 
to make sure that your program ultimately compiles and runs correctly on our 
csa2/csa3 machines where it will be graded. </font><H3>The routines you will write</H3>
<P>The procedures you will write are for the sending entity (A) and the 
receiving entity (B). Only unidirectional transfer of data (from A to B) is 
required. Of course, the B-side will have to send packets to A to acknowledge 
receipt of data. Your routines are to be implemented in the form of the 
procedures described below. These procedures will be called by (and will call) 
procedures that you are given which emulate a network environment. The overall 
structure of the environment is shown in the following Figure:<P>
<img border="0" src="figpa21.gif" width="663" height="254"><P>The unit of data passed between the upper layers and your protocols is a 
<I>message,</I> which is declared as: 
<P><!--mstheme--></font><PRE><TT>struct msg {
&nbsp; char data[20];
&nbsp; };</TT></PRE><!--mstheme--><font face="arial,arial,helvetica">
<P>This declaration, and all other data structure and emulator routines, as well 
as stub routines (i.e., those you are to complete) are in the file, 
<B>pa2.c,</B> described later. Your sending entity will thus receive data in 
20-byte chunks from layer5; your receiving entity should deliver 20-byte chunks 
of correctly received (and in sequence) data to layer5 at the receiving side. 
<P>The unit of data passed between your routines and the network layer is the 
<I>packet,</I> which is declared as: 
<P><!--mstheme--></font><PRE><TT>struct pkt {
&nbsp;&nbsp; int seqnum;
&nbsp;&nbsp; int acknum;
&nbsp;&nbsp; int checksum;
&nbsp;&nbsp; char payload[20];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</TT></PRE><!--mstheme--><font face="arial,arial,helvetica">
<P>Your routines will fill in the payload field from the message data passed 
down from layer5. The other packet fields will be used by your protocols to 
insure reliable delivery, as we've seen in class. 
<P>The routines you will write are detailed below. As noted above, such 
procedures in real-life would be part of the operating system, and would be 
called by other procedures in the operating system.

<H3>Implementing Go-Back-N</H3>
<P>You are to write the procedures, 
<TT>A_output(),A_input(),A_timerinterrupt(),A_init(),B_input(),</TT> and 
<TT>B_init()</TT> which together will implement a Go-Back-N unidirectional 
transfer of data from the A-side to the B-side. Your protocol should use only ACK 
(i.e. no NACK) messages. 
<P>You should put your procedures in a file called pa2.c. You will need the 
initial version of this file, containing the emulation routines you are given, 
and the stubs for your procedures. You can obtain this program
<a href="PA2_helper/GBN-C">here</a> together with a &quot;compile&quot; file - please use 
that compile file (which you may modify) and make sure your program runs on csa2 
or csa3.<P><B>This lab can be completed on any machine supporting C. It makes no use of 
UNIX features.</B> (You can simply&nbsp;copy the pa2.c file to whatever 
machine and OS you choose). 
<P>It is <B>STRONGLY</B> recommended that you first implement the  Alternating-Bit 
(stop-and-wait) protocol and then extend your code to implement the harder 
version 
(Go-Back-N). It will <B>not</B> be time wasted! However, some new 
considerations for your Go-Back-N code (which do not apply to the Alternating-Bit protocol) are:

  <P>Your A_output() routine will now sometimes be called when there are 
  outstanding, unacknowledged messages in the medium - implying that you will 
  have to buffer multiple messages in your sender. Also, you'll also need 
  buffering in your sender because of the nature of Go-Back-N: sometimes your 
  sender will be called but it won't be able to send the new message because the 
  new message falls outside of the window. 
  <P>Rather than have you worry about buffering an arbitrary number of messages, 
  it will be OK for you to have some finite, maximum number of buffers available 
  at your sender (say for 50 messages) and have your sender simply abort (give 
  up and exit) should all 50 buffers be in use at one point (Note: using the 
  values given below, this should never happen!) In the ``real-world,'' of 
  course, one would have to come up with a more elegant solution to the finite 
  buffer problem!

<h3>What to Submit</h3>
<P>Following our submission guidelines, you should 
hand in  a design document and a testing document (with sample outputs).  
<P>For your sample 
output, your procedures might print out a message whenever an event occurs at 
your sender or receiver (a message/packet arrival, or a timer interrupt) as well 
as any action taken in response.  
<P>You should hand in output 
for a run that was long enough so that at least 20 messages were successfully 
transferred from sender to receiver (i.e., the sender receives ACK for these 
messages), a window size of 8, a retransmission timeout of 20, a random seed of 
2233, a loss probability of 0.2, a corruption probability of 0.2, a trace level 
of 2, and a mean time between arrivals of 10. You should annotate parts of your 
printout with a colored pen showing how your protocol correctly recovered from 
packet (data and ack) loss and corruption. Make sure you 
distinguish which packets are delivered and which are <font face="Arial">not, 
identify at least one place where a full window is retransmitted after a 
timeout, identify at least one place where an ack is lost and a later cumulative 
ack in the same direction moves the sender's window by more than 1.</font><P>
<font face="Arial">Your program should also gather statistics (e.g. number of 
original data packets transmitted,&nbsp; number of retransmissions, number of 
ack packets, number of corrupted packets received, average RTT, etc.) under 
various loss and corruption probabilities. You should argue/show whether or not 
the loss and corruption values for each run (it should be long enough, say, with 
1000 messages) are reasonable. (Hint: if the loss probability is .1, then 
roughly 10% of the packets should have been lost. If the corruption probability 
is .15, then roughly 15% of the NON LOST packets should have been corrupted.) If 
your loss and corruption probabilities were not accurately simulated, your 
program may have a bug. </font><P><font face="Arial">Explain how you decided on 
the initial value of your retransmission timer, and how that value changes 
during the simulation. (Note: a static retransmission timer value is acceptable 
for this assignment.)</font>
<p>Produce a 
single meaningful figure that shows the average time to communicate a packet, 
that is, the time from when the packet is first sent into the network until the 
time when the sender receives the first ack for that packet (dependent variable), as a function of loss (independent variable) 
and corruption (independent variable). Consider a 3-D graph or a barchart. For 
your results to be statistically meaningful, you should present the average 
performance over several independent runs (i.e. with different  seeds for the 
random number generator) and 
compute confidence intervals (say, 90%) as a function of the sample mean 
(average) and sample standard deviation (Note: you may need to review this topic 
from your CS-350 notes or check these
<a href="http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan_Waner/RealWorld/finitetopic1/confint.html">
online notes</a> on how to compute confidence intervals.)

  Also simulate unidirectional    transfer of data using Selective Repeat and selective acks (rather than    cumulative acks as used in the Go-Back-N part.) Submit traces, statistics,    etc., that clearly demonstrates your code performs correctly. It is your    responsibility to provide output that convincingly demonstrates that your code    works correctly (similar to what was asked in the GBN part of the assignment).    Make sure you demonstrate the differences in behavior between SR and GBN by    appropriate annotations of your traces and by comparing various performance    metrics (e.g. throughput, goodput, and average packet delay).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
