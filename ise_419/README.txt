ISE 419/519
Binghamton University


This was a soft computing class I took in the Industrial System's Engineering Department
I took my senior year of undergraduate. The Nerual Network folder contains an implementation
of a neural network as a final project for this class. The neural network is written in python.
The final report is also included.
