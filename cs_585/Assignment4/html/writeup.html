<h2> Problem Definition </h2>

<!--
<p> <i>
Give a concise description of current problem. For instance, what
needs to be solved and why it is useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the difficulties?
</i></p>
-->
<p>
For this assignment we implemented basic tracking, inorder to study the movements
of bats in a cave and fishes in an aquariam. Series of images in both situations
were provided to us. We decided to implement the tracking using an alpha-beta filter.
We then tried to implement an instance of opencv's Kalman filter class, but ran into
complications in having it predict accurately and extend to more than one object.
<br/>
Tracking can be useful in studying the behavior of animal's over time. The challenges
that arise in tracking an animal, is that animal's can change the speed and direction
of movement at any time. Also animals can go in and out of the frame, making constant 
tracking difficult. As with most Image and Video problems ambiguities created by lighting
and image quality can also throw off tracking performance.

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<!--
<p><i>
	Give a concise description of the implemented method. 
	For example, you might describe the motivation of current idea, the algorithmic steps or any formulation used in current method.

<p><i>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out your algorithmic steps described above.

	<h4>Bats</h4>
	<p>
		For the tracking of bat's segmentation and localization files were provided to us.
		We used these files and and already written code to obtain the locations of bats, at 
		any image. We assumed the bat positions in frame 1 as our initial predictions, and a initial
		velocity of 0 for all bats. For the alpha and beta values we ended up choosing those
		experimentally as we were trying to tune the parameters.
		<br/>
		We then calculated for every initial point a new prediction point and then used
		smallest L1 distance between every measurement in the new frame to the set of
		predictions as a greedy algorithm to obtain a bipartite matching.
		<br/>
		After obtaining a bipartite matching, we then found the residual for every pair
		of points and then updated the predictive position and velocites accordingly.
		<br/>
		Finally before doing the next round of calculations we ploted a circle of the prediction
		on the original image to show each objects movement over time.
		
		
	</p>
	
	<h3>Fishes in an Aquarium</h3>
	<p>
		For this half of the project we had to first segement the fishes first before
		we could perform tracking on them. Fortuentely the fishes were circled in red.
		We then took the image and performed thersholding based on RGB values to try and
		segement the different fishes. After we then performed some morphological functions on the image.
		Specifically we dilated, eroded and closed the object in order to get better defined objects.
		After we used code from lab to get the vector<vector<Point2i>> (blobs) of the image
		We then ran through all the blobs,any that were less than 10 pixels in size were discounted. (to eliminate small white pixels).
		We then found an average of all points for each blob to obtain the centroid. We then
		saved all the centroids into a vector object and used this as our observed data points.
		After that we then  performed the same methods as above for tracking.
	</p>

<h3> An attempt at the Kalman Filter</h3>
<p>
	We made an attempt attempt at replacing the Aplha-Beta Filter with a Kalman figure.
	For each observed point, we tried to keep a Kalman filter in a Vector and update
	each Kalman filter respecitively. However when put into practice the Kalman filter
	always predicted 0,0. We then tried to reimplement for just one bat, but the predictions
	of the Kalman filter was still not predicting correctly.

<p>
For objects that didn't leave the frame or experience in lighting issues,
our managed to work sucessfully. We were able to track majority of the fishes
and bats. However there were a few edge cases where the basic tracking failed.
There was a fish that when swimming entered a dark spot in the water tank. 
The alogrithm track's it to the tank but then looses track of the fish as it disappears and then
reappears several frames later. The other was when a bat would leave and then re-enter the frame.
Finally sometimes when the fish were too close together the semgentation in our alogithm would
group them together as one fish.  In our algorithm,
spurious detections that do not connect with other measurements in subsequent frames are either
elimnated in the segmentation phase, or just paired up with the closest coresponding prediction point.

<br/>

One way to deal with the lighting problem as well as objects leaving the frame issue,
would be to implement multiple hypothesis tracking. 

<br/>
I do not think it is sufficient to just consider distances, since if a bat flies
fast enough, it's centroid in subsequent frames may no longer be the cloest point to the prediciton
of the alpha beta filter and would throw of the tracking algorithm.

<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<!--
<p><i>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?
</i></p>
-->
<p>
Overall I'm happy with our results. In the future we would like to implement
mutiple hypothesis tracking utilizing the kalman filter.
